Description: By adding dependencies to the "Suggests" field of a package's
    DESCRIPTION file, and then declaring that they are needed within any
    dependent functionality, it is often possible to significantly reduce the
    number of "hard" dependencies required by a package. This package provides
    a minimal way to declare when a suggested package is needed.
